# About Me 👋

Hello there! I'm **Mohammad Mehdi Jafari**, but you can just call me **Meti**. 🚀

## Background 🎓

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering - Hardware from Shiraz University, where I initially delved into the world of hardware but soon realized my passion lay elsewhere. The journey through signal processing, control, and linear algebra paved the way for me to evolve into a proficient machine learning engineer.

For my Master's degree at Shahid Beheshti University, I made the exciting leap into the realm of AI, focusing on natural language processing and dialogue systems. The mysteries behind the Turing Test and the Chinese Room Argument fascinated me then and continue to fuel my curiosity.

## Professional Journey 💼

Throughout my professional experiences, I've worn multiple hats—NLP specialist, Data Scientist, Data Engineer. My journey has been dynamic, and I'm always eager to adapt and learn. You can find my latest adventures on my [updated CV](https://github.com/meti-94/meti-94.github.io/blob/main/_data/CV_Mohammad%20Mehdi%20Jafari.pdf) for more in-depth details.
